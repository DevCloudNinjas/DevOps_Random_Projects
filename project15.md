# AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY
## INTRODUCTION

This project demostrates how a secure infrastructure inside AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network is built for a particular company, who uses WordPress CMS for its main business website, and a Tooling Website for their DevOps team. As part of the companyâ€™s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this. The infrastructure will look like following diagram:

The following outlines the steps taken:

## STEP 1: Setting Up a Sub-account And Creating A Hosted Zone
- Creating a sub-account 'DevOps' from my AWS master account in the AWS Organisation Unit console 

![](./img/project15/12-adding%20new%20aws%20account.png)

- Creating an AWS Organization Unit (OU) 'Dev' within the Root account(Dev resources will be launched in there)

![](./img/project15/14-creating%20new%20aws%20organisation.png)

- Moving the DevOps account into the Dev OU

## STEP 8: Creating TLS Certificates From Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)
 TLS certificates is created to handle secured connectivity to the Application Load Balancers (ALB)
- Navigating to AWS ACM
- Requesting a public wildcard certificate for the domain name you registered in Freenom
- Using DNS to validate the domain name

![](./img/project15/55-requesting%20certificate.png)
![](./img/project15/cert.png)

## STEP 9: Configuring Application Load Balancer (ALB)
**For External Load Balancer**
- Selecting Internet facing option
- Ensuring that it listens on HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443)
- Ensuring the ALB is created within the appropriate VPC, AZ and the right Subnets
- Choosing the Certificate already created from ACM
- Selecting Security Group for the external load balancer
- Selecting Nginx Instances as the target group

![](./img/project15/56-creating%20alb%20for%20public.png)
![](./img/project15/56-creating%20alb%20for%20public-2.png)

- Ensuring that it listens on HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443)
- Ensuring the ALB is created within the appropriate VPC, AZ and Subnets
- Choosing the Certificate already created from ACM
- Selecting Security Group for the internal load balancer
- Selecting webserver Instances as the target group
- Ensuring that health check passes for the target group

![](./img/project15/57-creating%20alb%20for%20private.png)
![](./img/project15/57-creating%20alb%20for%20private-2.png)
![](./img/project15/57-creating%20alb%20for%20private-3.png)
![](./img/project15/57-creating%20alb%20for%20private-4.png)

**Configuring the Listener on the Internal ALB to route traffic to wordpress server**

![](./img/project15/58-configuring%20listener%20for%20internal%20lb.png)
![](./img/project15/58-configuring%20listeners%20for%20internal%20lb-2.png)

## STEP 10: Setting Up EFS Storage For The Webservers

- Create an EFS filesystem
- Create an EFS mount target per AZ in the VPC, associate it with both subnets dedicated for data layer
- Associate the Security groups created earlier for data layer.
- Create an EFS access point. (Give it a name and leave all other settings as default)

![](./img/project15/efs.png)
![](./img/project15/efs-1.png)

![](./img/project15/rds-2.png)
![](./img/project15/rds-3.png)
![](./img/project15/rds-4.png)

## STEP 13: Creating DNS Records In The Route53 For the Tooling And Wordporess site 
**For Tooling DNS record**

![](./img/project15/tooling%20dns%20record.png)

**For Wordpress record**

![](./img/project15/wordpress%20dns%20record.png)

## STEP 14: Result
- Entering the url https://www.wordpress.somdev.ga will route traffic from the application load balancer to the nginx and then to the server for wordpress site through the internal ALB:

![](./img/project15/wordpress%20result.png)

- Entering the url https://www.tooling.somdev.ga will route traffic from the application load balancer to the nginx and then to the internal ALB which forwards the traffic to the server for tooling site:
